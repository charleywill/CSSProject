        <h2>Diversity, Equity, & Inclusion Statement</h2>
        <p>Music brings people together to inspire and unite the human spirit. The Colorado Symphony Association (CSA) believes that symphonic music must be available to everyone and that communities thrive when music is accessible to all.<br>
        The CSA is committed to being an inclusive organization where diverse perspectives are sought out and valued; and to create experiences for our audiences where all people and communities feel welcome, represented, and connected. The CSA will continuously strive to achieve greater inclusivity and equity by leading in a way that represents our art form, one of collectivism and harmony. <br>
        The CSA believes in the dignity of all and respects a diversity of cultures, identities, orientations, heritages, beliefs, and experiences. As a cultural institution and only full-time professional symphony orchestra in the state, we recognize the power of symphonic music and believe we can bring our community together to create greater social understanding through live symphonic music.</p>

        <h2>What We Offer</h2>
        <p>Each season the Colorado Symphony presents a wealth of world-class artistry performed by your critically-acclaimed orchestra, the region’s only full-time professional orchestra. We present performances and/or events almost every weekend, September through May. Concert categories include Classics, Symphony Pops, Spotlight,  Family, Holiday,  Movie at the Symphony, Alternative, and even our Summer performances, which feature numerous concerts at the historic Red Rocks Amphitheater.<br>
        In addition to our standard concert season, we’re happy to provide plenty of other fun opportunities for events and activities. Support the symphony by participating in great annual events like the Symphony Gala and social networking opportunities through Colorado Symphony Young Professionals, the Colorado Symphony Guild, Women of Note, and more. Throughout the season you’ll also find pre and post-concert events, like Preludes & Talkbacks, that will make your concert experience extra special. Plus, make a donation to the Colorado Symphony and receive access to special donor events like open rehearsals, happy hours, master classes, and more.<br>
        We offer a wide array of experiences that can involve you and your partner, or you can bring the kids for pre-concert HalfNotes activities and special events geared specifically toward their growing knowledge and love of music. With our commitment to serving the community with culturally enriching musical experiences, we hope that you will visit for any one of our special events or performances. Bring your friends—we have events and activities for everyone’s tastes!</p>
